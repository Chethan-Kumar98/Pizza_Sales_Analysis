# Pizza_Sales_Analysis
This repository contains the Pizza Sales Analysis project, which involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a pizza sales dataset using MySQL. The project was conducted with the goal of gaining insights into pizza sales patterns and generating valuable business metrics for decision-making. The dataset consists of four CSV files: orders, order details, pizzas, and pizza types. These files were imported into a MySQL database and analyzed using various SQL queries and techniques.

Key Insights and Analysis Questions:

1. Total Number of Orders: Calculated the total number of pizza orders in the dataset.
2. Total Revenue: Determined the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
3. Highest Priced Pizza: Identified the highest priced pizza in the dataset.
4. Most Common Pizza Size: Analyzed the most commonly ordered pizza size.
5. Top 5 Most Ordered Pizzas: Listed the top 5 most ordered pizzas, including their quantities.
6. Top 5 Most Ordered Pizza Types: Identified the top 5 most ordered pizza types and their quantities.
7. Pizza Category Orders: Joined relevant tables to calculate the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
8. Orders by Hour of Day: Determined the distribution of orders by hour of the day to understand peak ordering times.
9. Category-wise Pizza Distribution: Analyzed pizza orders by category using SQL joins and aggregations.
10. Average Daily Orders: Grouped the orders by date to calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
11. Top 3 Pizza Types by Revenue: Analyzed the top 3 pizza types based on their revenue generation.
12. Percentage Contribution to Revenue: Calculated the percentage contribution of each pizza type to the total revenue.
13. Cumulative Revenue Over Time: Performed a cumulative revenue analysis to track sales trends over time.
14. Top 3 Pizza Types by Revenue per Category: Determined the top 3 most ordered pizza types by revenue for each pizza category.

Key MySQL Techniques Used:

  1. SELECT, GROUP BY, and HAVING: For summarizing data and applying conditional filters.
  2. JOINs: For combining data from multiple tables to perform comprehensive analysis.
  3. WHERE Clause: For filtering specific data based on given conditions.
  4. ORDER BY: For sorting data results.
  5. Window Functions: For calculating cumulative revenue and other running totals.
  6. Aggregate Functions: For calculating sums, averages, and other key metrics.

Tools Used:

  1. MySQL Workbench: The primary tool used to import the dataset, create tables, and execute SQL queries.
  2. CSV Files: Data was provided in CSV format, containing sales and order-related information.

This project showcases how SQL can be applied to real-world datasets to uncover valuable insights, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions. It also demonstrates proficiency in MySQL database management, data manipulation, and complex query writing.
